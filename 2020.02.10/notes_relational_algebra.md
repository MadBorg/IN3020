# Relational algebra

We have so far looked at sets but now we want to talk about bags.

## Division

...

## End of sets. Now bags (multi set)

* Allows dupicates
* The order doent matter


## why bags and not sets

* Bags are more effcient most of the times
* Aggregation need bags'
* but more space consuming than set

## Relational operators on Bags

* The definitions bacome slighly different.
* not al algebraic laws that hold for sets hold for bags
  * Example: (R u S) - T = (R- T) u (S-T)
