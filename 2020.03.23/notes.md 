## Exe plans

* exe plan - shcedule S for a set of transactions {T_1, ..., T_n} is a mergin of the operations in T_1, ..., T_n
* Features/characteristics of S:
  * Each element in S is an operatrion in exactly one of the transactions
* not all serial plans give the same answer
* T_i is a transaction
* Ensure that concurrency dont create problems

## Conflic serialisations

* Transaction: ...
* Transaction exe plan: A merge of T_1, ..., T_n
* Serial exe plan: Wich transaction, wich operation
* Conflic in an exe plan:
  1. Read write conflic: ...
  2. Wirite wirte conflict: if T_i is writing and some other T is writing to the same
  3. Intra transacton conflict: ...

## Conflict serializability

* S_1 is serial S_2 not serialiseble, but S_2 can be transformed to S_1 by changing the order of operations, then it is conflict serializeble
